# Linkedin-Data-Set
An attempt to scrape data from LinkedIn to extract job related insights 3-5 months down the line.
I've just finished learning the basics of Python and NPV(numpy pandas visualization) recently,
so I thought this process of acquiring data is pretty neat and super quick.

The project and the code itself is very basic. So if you'd like to use it.....have fun!!
I plan to start tweaking the initial code with new concepts I'll soon learn.

Note:Replace the XXXXXXX with your LinkedIn ID and password

Week 1: LinkedIn webscraper V1
      - A piece of code which when given your LinkedIn credentials will open up linkedin and get the 'Job Title','Company name and 'Job Location' from the first page of the search index


Will update .csv file once a week
if you have any queries or doubts feel free to reach out to me!
